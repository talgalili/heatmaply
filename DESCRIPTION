Description: Create interactive 'heatmaps' that are usable from the R console,
    in the 'RStudio' viewer pane, in 'R Markdown' documents, and in 'Shiny' apps.
    Hover the mouse pointer over a cell to show details or drag a rectangle to
    zoom. A 'heatmap' is a popular graphical method for visualizing high-dimensional
    data, in which a table of numbers are encoded as a grid of colored cells. The
    rows and columns of the matrix are ordered to highlight patterns and are often
    accompanied by 'dendrograms'. 'Heatmaps' are used in many fields for visualizing
    observations, correlations, missing values patterns, and more. Interactive
    'heatmaps' allow the inspection of specific value by hovering the mouse over a
    cell, as well as zooming into a region of the 'heatmap' by dragging a rectangle
    around the relevant area. This work is based on the 'ggplot2' and 'plotly.js'
    engine. It produces similar 'heatmaps' as 'd3heatmap', with the advantage of speed
    ('plotly.js' is able to handle larger size matrix), and the ability to zoom from
    the 'dendrogram' panes.
