heatmaply 0.3.0 (2016-05-25)
==============================


### NEW FEATURES
* heatmaply
  * Now works with Rowv=F and Colv=F (by introducing a new un-exported function: heatmap_subplot_from_ggplotly)
  * Remove space between the heatmap and dendrograms (via: coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE)  and coord_flip(expand = FALSE))
  * Added the margin parameter (to control the distance between the heatmap and the dendrograms.)
  * Added row_text_angle and column_text_angle (with srtRow and srtCol for backward compatibility with gplots::heatmap.2). Fix #3

### BUG FIXES
* fix #2 : Error: Don't know how to add scale_fill_gradient_fun to a plot
  by moving "scale_fill_gradient_fun" after "..." (I may change this parameter's name later)

* add bars for extra categories
* remove hover information from dendrograms
* remove unneeded code from d3heatmap
* add many options for controlling the heatmap "as it should be"
* implement all relevant options streight to heatmaply.
* ggheatmap?
* Expose widths and heights from heatmap_subplot_from_ggplotly to heatmaply

* write a post!
